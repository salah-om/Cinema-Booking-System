# Cinema-Booking-System
The cinema booking system lets customers book tickets and admins manage movies. Customers log in to browse and book available movies, with tickets viewable in a dedicated section. Admins have a separate dashboard to view movie and user counts, add or delete movies, and access registered user details.
